## Welcome to My Matlab GitHub Page

The first time I heard about Matlab I thought it would be an additional class requirement that I did not want to have.
Too bad. I guess somethings are meant to be.

Little did I know that the things I found mostly interesting in my Calculus III courses had all to do with it.
To be honest, I always had a thing for mathematics in general.

It's really interesting to see how life has gone from the many different points I look back to.
A lot had been dealt, for good, and some that I've taken for granted.

Perhaps, I didn't take it for granted. I just always felt too humble to take such opportunities as I was given so early in life.
Responsibility for saying such big words is not little.

After having produced my first term project, and early this month finally attempting to understand all that information meant was hard.

However, the application of one essential thought,
a circular discretization,
an orthogonal <-> polar coordinate association,
would allow for the development of a new way of doing data analysis.

<b>It was September 27th</b> that I posted the Musical Nautilus up... 
This is the story of the thoughts behind it!
